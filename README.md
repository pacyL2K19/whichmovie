## üîß Setup and Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pacyL2K19/whichmovie.git
cd whichmovie
```
### Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Setup a Weaviate Cluster

Follow [This guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart) and make sure you get your cluster API Key and url

You will also need a `HuggingFace` API Key to proceed. Having a HF account, you can get yours [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```md
WCD_URL=your-weaviate-cloud-domain
WCD_API_KEY=your-weaviate-cloud-api-key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-hf-api-key
```

### Create a Collection and seed data

You need to create a new collection in your cluster in order to start querying the database.
Fortunately, we have created a set of customizable commands to easily set your environment

- Start with creating a new collection running the following command, passing your keys as arguments(replace placeholders with real values):
    ```bash
    yarn collection:create --collectionName=Movie --eraseIfExists=true --hfAPIKey=<YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_APIKEY> --wcdUrl=<YOUR_WCD_URL> --wcdApiKey=<YOUR_WDC_KEY>
    ```
- The command above will create a new collection and optionally erase an existing collection with the same name, you can pass whatever boolean to the `--eraseIfExists` argument depending on your use case. Then seed some data in your collection. In the context of movie recommendation, we have a small dataset of movies, feel free to use any source of your need. Run the following command to seed your collection with some data:
    ```bash
    yarn collection:seed-data --collectionName=Movie --hfAPIKey=<YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_APIKEY> --wcdUrl=<YOUR_URL> --wcdApiKey=<YOUR_WDC_KEY>
    ```
- [optional]: you can drop your collection anytime you want using the following command:
    ```bash
    yarn collection:drop --collectionName=Movie --hfAPIKey=<YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_APIKEY> --wcdUrl=<YOUR_URL> --wcdApiKey=<YOUR_WDC_KEY>
    ```

### Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
Open the application in your browser

http://localhost:3000

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The application uses a dataset of popular movies to provide recommendations. Any source can be used here, for a demo purpose, we have a list of movies under the `data/dumb.ts` file. Feel free to use anyother data source.

## üöß Future Enhancements

- **Search by Image:** Add support for blobs and image search functionality.
- **User Accounts:** Allow users to create accounts and save their favorite movies.
- **Advanced Filters:** Add filters for genre, rating, and year to refine search results.
